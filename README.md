- Pitch: [Overtrust - Chainlink BlockMagic Hackathon](https://youtu.be/KIor0I9amyM)

## Project name
Overtrust

## Elevator pitch
Our project aims to be the world's first digital score rating, cross-referencing data from users, banks, fintechs, and onchain and offchain data acquired through the Chainlink CCIP.

## Inspiration
Our inspiration is given by the excellence of Chainlink Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) in providing onchain and offchain data, together with the expertise of our team in the practices of financial institutions in the analysis of the profile of their customers, a world's first digital score rating proved to be the best project aligning Chainlink solutions and the experiences of our team.

## What it does
Our project integrates frontend, backend, and blockchain to converge data from users, banks, fintechs, and onchain and offchain data into a digital score rating. On the frontend, the registration of operations, registration of data assignor, registration of partners, among others, are carried out. On the backend, frontend processes and web3 wallets (such as MetaMask) are integrated. On the blockchain, the offchain and onchain data required for the digital score rating is acquired and reported.

## How we built it
Our frontend is built in Angular. Our backend was built with Node.js API. Our database was built in PostgreSQL. Our blockchain was built with Chainlink CCIP.

## Challenges we ran into
Our team faced challenges mainly in frontend/backend/blockchain integrations. However, due to the individual mastery of the tools, it was possible to integrate them satisfactorily within the deadline of the hackathon.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our team is proud to have achieved satisfactory frontend/backend/blockchain integration within the hackathon deadline. There were numerous tests, and many approaches considered until the adoption of the solution presented in our project.

## What we learned
Our team learned the importance of mastering the technologies individually, understanding their pros and cons to be able to scale the most appropriate solutions to meet the demands of the project.

## What's next for Overtrust
The next steps of our projects are to increase the backend features, Open Finance Data, and integrate RWA (Real World Assets) with the data that generates users' digital score ratings.
